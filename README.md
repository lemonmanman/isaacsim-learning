# My Personal Isaac-Sim Learning Recording 

This package contains my personal records of isaac sim using, which serves as a quick enter and assists me in collecting bugs that I've ever met so that I can turn to them when I encounter them for the second time.

My ubuntu version is 24.04.

You can find:
- [github using reminds](/github%20using%20reminds)
- [isaac-sim installation](/isaac-sim%20installation)
- [isaac-sim starting](isaac-sim%20starting)
- [robot description making](robot%20description%20making)

The official tutorial can be found in [isaacsim official](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/6.0.0/index.html).
